# Hi! My name is Ekaterina

I'm 37 and I decided to change my life by getting a new profession of _QA specialist_.
I'm studying in Netology from the beginning of December and I'm still interested.

## I've chosen the QA course because:

* I am not sure  I'm ready to code 24/7
* I have no programming or design background
* I like to put the things in order (whatever they are)
* Sometimes I can be **too** focused on details to reach the perfection
* I like to be a team player to create something interesting and high quality

I hope this profession will let me start a new carrier and apply the knowledge and skills to participate in many exciting and interesting projects. 

Me looking to a bright future :)
